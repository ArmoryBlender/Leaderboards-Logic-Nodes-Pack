These Logic Nodes are used to create a leaderboard in armory3d for offline games! For arcade games this node pack is useful for writing the highscore of the game. 

# Idea
This idea came from one of the most famous games of all time pacman. I wanted to re-create a highscore system in armory3d because this wasn't possible with logic nodes until now. It was way too difficult to create this with the already built in logic nodes. For everyone who cannot code this will be a very useful node pack. I really hope you enjoy!!
